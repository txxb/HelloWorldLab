Hi!

This class activity project updates the hello message to include the name that you provide.

This project probably isn't that useful to you. But we learned about readme files from it. 

Fork this repo & head over to Andrioid Studio to clone it. After that you can get started programming the project. 

Google provides ample documentation if you get stuck. 

This project is maintained by Professor Karl Morris and CIS3515 students.
